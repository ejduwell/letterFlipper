# letterFlipper

Repository of code which establishes a generalized framework for building and running visual stimuli presenting letters in MATLAB with Psychtoolbox.

## General Overview:

**letterFlipper** is a MATLAB repository developed for building and implimenting cognitive vision science experiments presenting letter-containing stimuli with Psychtoolbox. **letterFlipper** contains generalized code enabling users to quickly and flexibly design and run wide range of potential visual tasks presenting letters/characters.

## Brief List of Built in Capabilities:

- Separate functions and workflows for image/task creation and task presentation enable users to develop and impliment tasks in a modular manner:
    - **letterFlipper** has separate, 'stand-alone' functions/workflows for both generating the stack of images and files presented in an experiment and for presenting them in the precise manner desired.
    - In other words, **letterFlipper** allows users to flexibly pre-generate a set of task images/rules with a "letter image/task generation" workflow and impliment/present them in desired manner using a separate "letter image flipper" task presentation workflow.
      
- Frameworks for creating and running tasks are highly generalized and are capable of both generating and implimenting a wide range of potential different tasks with minimal coding.
    - **Q:** *How does **letterFlipper** achieve this?* **A:** *Parameter Descriptor Files!*
      - Users can flexibly create and update 'parameter descriptor files' (see [Usage](https://github.com/ejduwell/letterFlipper/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#short-list-of-important-files-and-foldersdirectories)) for details)
      - These allow users to define/specify all relevant aspects of task.
      - The "image flipper" for presenting stimuli and collecting data is highly generalized and can run any task generated by the "letter image/task generation workflow" without any updating or re-coding.
      - Consequently, users can create, develop, and run a wide range of letter-based visual stimuli with **letterFlipper** by simply specifying new sets of parameters in different parameter descriptor files.
        
- Task image parameter maniplations currently supported by letterFlipper out-of-the-box allow users to specify:
  - the set of letters presented
      - a 'Snellen E Mode" allows users to generate and present 'Snellen-like' letter 'E' stimuli similar to those used in clinical ophthalmology exams
  - the number of letters presented per task image.
  - the set of different locations in which letters can appear
  - the set of possible text sizes
  - the set of possible text colors/luminance values in the form of rgb vectors
  - the set of possible rotation angles applied to letters
  - specify which of these parameters is the "response parameter" to which subjects will be responding via pressing butons thoughout the task
  - specify the corresponding set of expected button presses for each possible response parameter value

- Task presentation/implimentation parameter maniplations currently supported by letterFlipper out-of-the-box allow users to specify:
    - the # of trials per run
    - the number of runs per block
    - low-level trial architecture / timing parameters such as:
      - image presentation onset and disappearance times
      - response window length
      - interstimulus interval time between trials
    - QUEST-related parameters controling how the QUEST staircase procedure will function during the task including:
      - total # of interleaved QUEST procedures to run (Can handle any desired # of interleaved QUESTS from 1 to N)
      - the desired accuracy threshold for each QUEST to 'home in on'
      - QUEST starting parameter values

### General workflow for creating and running stimuli with letterFlipper:

As described above, **letterFlipper** is capbable of generating and running a wide range of potential stimulus designs.

However, regardless of the details of any particular use case, the creation of tasks with letterFlipper should always follow the following general workflow:

---
> - **Step 00:** Make a new `txtTaskImgBuilderPDF_##.m` instance/copy for this task, and adjust parameters to set desired stimulus image and response parameters
> - **Step 01:** Generate the desired stimulus image files using `txtPltCntrlFixImgStackBldr_v1.m`.
> - **Step 02:** Make a new `genImgFlipperPDF_##.m` instance/copy for this task pointing to stimulus files created in **Step 01** and adjust other stimulus presentation parameters as desired.
> - **Step 03:** Update a single parameter in `genImgFlipperMain_v1.m` to point to your newly created `genImgFlipperPDF_##.m` instance.
> - **Step 04:** Run `genImgFlipperMain_v1.m` to run the task.
